This is a placeholder for the apple-touch-icon.png file.
To create the actual file, you'll need to:
1. Take the logo_notext_color.svg file
2. Convert it to a 180x180 PNG with a white or transparent background
3. Replace this placeholder file with the generated PNG

You can use online converters like:
- https://convertio.co/svg-png/
- https://www.freeconvert.com/svg-to-png
- Or use command line tools like ImageMagick

The recommended approach is to use the logo_notext_color.svg as the base.
