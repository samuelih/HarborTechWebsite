This is a placeholder for the favicon.ico file.
To create the actual file, you'll need to:
1. Take the logo_notext_color.svg file
2. Convert it to a 32x32 ICO format
3. Replace this placeholder file with the generated ICO

You can use online converters like:
- https://convertio.co/svg-ico/
- https://www.favicon-generator.org/
- Or use command line tools like ImageMagick

The recommended approach is to use the logo_notext_color.svg as the base.
